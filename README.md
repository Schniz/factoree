# `factoree`

> ðŸ’¥ðŸ”’ Fail early, fail fast: type-safe and runtime-safe partial factories for TypeScript

The ease of `x as any as MyType` without getting weird `undefined`s: `factoree` provides a strict factory for testing. Ensures you don't accidentally access a field you haven't created, and therefore helping with catching bugs early on.

```ts
import { factory } from 'factoree';

type User = { name: string; twitterHandle?: string };

const createUser = factory<User>({ twitterHandle: undefined });

const gal = createUser({ name: 'Gal', twitterHandle: 'galstar' }); // => User
const joe = createUser({}); // => User

gal.name; // => "Gal"
joe.name; // => Error! Can't access undefined key 'name' for object {twitterHandle: undefined}
```

All of them also run in CI, so it will build if lint fails, etc.
